# Introduction to Algorithms using Go

Implementation of classic algorithms and data structures from the **CLRS (Introduction to Algorithms)** book, written in **Go**.

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains Go implementations of algorithms and data structures covered in the CLRS textbook, organized by topic.  
Each implementation aims to be:
- **Simple** and **idiomatic Go**
- **Well-documented** with comments
- **Educational**, matching the logic from the book

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Arrays and Basic Operations (sum)
- Sorting algorithms (Insertion, Merge Sort)
- More topics coming soon...

## 🧩 Contributing

Pull requests and discussions are welcome — feel free to add new algorithms or improve existing ones.
